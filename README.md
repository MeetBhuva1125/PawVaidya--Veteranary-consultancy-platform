## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

*   **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**: For cloning the repository.
*   **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** (which includes npm - Node Package Manager): Required to run the JavaScript applications.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Cloning the Repository

1.  **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account.
2.  **Clone your forked repository** to your local machine using the command below, replacing `YOUR_FORK_URL` with the URL of your forked repo:
    ```bash
    git clone YOUR_FORK_URL
    ```
3.  **Navigate into the cloned project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd <project-folder-name>
    ```

### Installation

This project is structured into three main sub-folders: `Admin`, `frontend`, and `Backend`. Each of these contains its own dependencies that need to be installed separately.

For each sub-folder, navigate into it and run `npm install`:

1.  **Backend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd Backend
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```
2.  **Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```
3.  **Admin Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd Admin
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

### Running the Application

To run the complete application, you will need to start the backend server, the frontend development server, and optionally the admin panel development server. It is recommended to use **separate terminal windows** for each part.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    Open a new terminal window, navigate to the `Backend` directory, and run:
    ```bash
    cd Backend
    npm run server
    ```
    This will start your API server (e.g., typically on `http://localhost:3000` or similar, depending on configuration).

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    Open another new terminal window, navigate to the `frontend` directory, and run:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the main website's development server, usually accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

3.  **Start the Admin Development Server (If separate and needed):**
    If the Admin panel is a standalone application that requires its own development server, open a third terminal window, navigate to the `Admin` directory, and run:
    ```bash
    cd Admin
    npm run dev
    ```
    *Note: If the Admin panel runs on a different port or is accessed via the main frontend, please consult its specific documentation for the correct access URL.*

Once all necessary servers are running, you can access the main website in your browser at:

[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

## Project Structure

*   `Admin/`: Contains the code for the administrative panel.
*   `frontend/`: Contains the code for the main user-facing website.
*   `Backend/`: Contains the server-side code and API endpoints.

<!-- ## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project! Please follow these guidelines:

1.  **Sync Your Fork:** Regularly sync your forked repository with the upstream `main` branch to ensure you are working with the latest updates and releases.
2.  **Create a New Branch:** For your changes, create a new feature or bugfix branch in your forked repository (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`).
3.  **Make Changes:** Implement your desired features or bug fixes.
4.  **Test Thoroughly:** Before submitting, ensure your changes work as expected on your local machine.
5.  **Create a Pull Request (PR):** Once your changes are ready, create a pull request from your new branch to the `main` branch of the original repository.
    *   For detailed steps on creating a pull request from a fork, refer to GitHub's documentation: [Creating a pull request from a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). -->
